# Text Summarization and Evaluation Project

This project focuses on summarizing text using word2vec vectors and evaluating the summaries using various datasets. The implementation is modular, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts for better code organization and maintainability.

## Project Structure

- `text_summarizer.py`: Contains the `TextSummarizer` class with methods for summarizing text.
- `dataset_evaluator.py`: Contains the `DatasetEvaluator` class for evaluating the summarizer on multiple datasets.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the summarization and evaluation process.
- `README.md`: This file containing project details and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
